## Functionality

* First of all, it is necessary to enter a sequence of digits separated by whitespaces of the first number, than press Enter and do the same for the second number. They can have leading zeros, but the length of each should not exceed 100 characters.

* In case of any input error, the program will be executed with the message "Error in input".

* If everything in input is fine, there will be shown the sum of numbers.

* Subtraction of numbers will be shown only if the first number is more or equal to the second. In other case there will be displayed a message "Second number is more than first one so unsigned subtraction cannot be computed".
